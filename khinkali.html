        <p>
            Khinkali (also known as Chinkali or Xinkali) are stuffed pasta dumplings that are a favorite dish from the Country of Georgia.

<p>They are similar to Chinese Soup Dumplings, 
(Xiao Long Bao), but are much larger
 than their bite-sized cousins.</p>

<P>These hearty little bags of goodness are 
typically served up on large platters and 
shared with friends.</P>

       
        <p>
            Here are the most common ingredients used to make the dish:

                1/2 cup water

        <p> And here is how you make it:
        </p>

    <div class="ordered">
        <ol>
            <li>The dough is the first thing you need to make when making your khinkali. The dough recipe is straightforward to make. All you need is flour, a little salt, eggs, and some water. Pour your flour into a large bowl and mix it with a bit of salt to make it flavorful. Then add an egg to it. 

            </li>
            <li>Pour some water and mix until the flour is combined with the egg and water, forming a powdery dough. If necessary, add more water. It is better to be careful; add less water than you think and add little water if needed while kneading. Because in this case, you can more easily control the dough so that it is not too sticky.

            </li>
            <li>After forming the dough, roll it on a lightly floured work surface and knead the dough with your hands for about 5 minutes. This step is necessary to produce a level of gluten in the dough that allows you to shape it into meatballs easily. Your dough should form quickly and not stick to your hands.

            </li>
            <li>After the dough is kneading, place it in a clean bowl where you have greased the bottom and sides (to prevent sticking!), cover it, and set it aside. 

            </li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 2 equal parts and spread it on a clean, floured surface with a rolling pin. Using a glass or a round pastry mold, mold the dough to a diameter of 3 cm and then smooth and spread each part with a rolling pin. 

            </li>
            <li> Mix the meat with all the mentioned ingredients and knead. Take 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of meat, place it in the middle of the dough, and wrap and fold it around the dough in accordion style. 



            </li>
            <li>Secure the top to prevent the contents from spilling out. Place the meatballs in a pot of boiling salted water. When they float to the surface (bottom side up) after about 7 minutes, they are done cooking. 


            </li>

        </ol>
