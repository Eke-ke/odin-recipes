            Georgia is generally considered the ‘cradle of wine’, as archaeologists have traced the world’s first known wine creation back to the people of the South Caucasus in 6,000BC. These early Georgians discovered grape juice could be turned into wine by burying it underground for the winter. Some of the qvevris they were buried in could remain underground for up to 50 years.

<p>             Wine continued to be important to the Georgians, who incorporated it into art and sculpture, with grape designs and evidence of wine-drinking paraphernalia found at ruins and burial sites.

The research on creating a Martian-friendly grape has been launched in a number of countries including Georgia. Georgia has unique opportunities to succeed in terms of growing vine species on Mars since ancient vine cultivation is familiar to the country. </li>
