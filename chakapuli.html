            A springtime stew made with lamb or veal, sour plums, white wine and plenty of tarragon, this chakapuli recipe modernizes the technique a bit and results in a seriously decadent and bright stew that will knock your socks off.

<p> Chakapuli kind of epitomizes springtime in Georgia and its bright, vibrant flavours are the perfect ushers of warmer weather after a long and cold winter. Traditionally eaten at Easter (which is by far the most important holiday in Georgia), this dish is one of the most popular dishes in the country. Using a lot of traditional Georgian flavours and ingredients, itâ€™s also relatively easy to make.

            Here are the most common ingredients used to make the dish:
