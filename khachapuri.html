            According to Darra Goldstein, author of “The Georgian Feast“, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact chronology of this elaboration. It probably dates back to the 12th century when Georgia went through the Renaissance. The name connects two different cultures. The word “khacha” in Georgian means “curdled cheese” and “puri“, which comes from India and means “bread“.</p>

<p> Dali Tsatava, former professor of gastronomy at the Georgian Culinary Academy in Tbilisi, states that the khachapuri could be a “cousin” of pizza. He says that Roman soldiers passed through the Black Sea area and brought with them recipes, including one that might resemble a pizza.

        <p> And here is how you make it:
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="ordered">
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Then add warm milk. Using the hook attachment, knead the dough until it takes shape. Then add oil and knead some more.

            </li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl. Cover and let it double in size. Remove from bowl and divide the dough into 4 boat-shaped pieces. Place the bread boast on a baking sheet lined with parchment.


            </li>
            <li>Combine the three kinds of cheese and fill each bread boat. Using a pastry brush, brush with egg wash and bake for 15 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Pull the khachapuri out of the oven, then make a well in the middle. Drop the egg in the center, add pieces of butter to the melted cheese, and bake for another 5-6 minutes.
