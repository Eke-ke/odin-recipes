            These Georgian mtsvadi, or grilled meat skewers, are made from well-marbled pork shoulder tossed with raw onions and finished with freshly squeezed pomegranate juice. Leave the fat intact for sizzling, juicy meat with plenty of crispy bits. In Georgia, the skewers are often grilled over the embers of grape vines. They're traditionally served with tkemali, a fantastically sour plum sauce. Break these kebabs out for a summer cookout, or serve them with pkhali, khachapuri, and eggplant and walnut rolls for a Georgian-style dinner party.

            Here are the most common ingredients used to make the dish:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="unordered">
        <ul>
            <li> 2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks.
                
                Olive oil, for greasing.</li>
                <li>                2 medium red onions (1 grated on a box grater and 1 thinly sliced into rings), divided.
                </li>
                <li>                2 1/2 cups red wine vinegar.
                </li>
                <li>                2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste.
                </li>
                <li>                1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste.
                </li>
                <li>                1/2 cup pomegranate arils.
                </li>
    


        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="story2">
        <p> And here is how you make it:
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="ordered">
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the meat into medium-sized pieces and slice onions into rings. Put the two in a pot, mix and sprinkle with dried spices, pepper, finely pounded coriander seeds and salt. Pour on pomegranate juice, two spoonfuls of oil and mix again. Take a large plate, flip it and cover the spiced-up meat. Make sure to put something heavy on the overturned plate to ensure that it presses down hard and the meat remains completely submerged in pomegranate juice.


            </li>
            <li>Ideally the meat should remain that way in the fridge for 2 days, but if you are in a rush, one day is enough.


            </li>
            <li>Skewer the meat and roast it on hot coals.


            </li>
            <li>Remember: As the fat drips off the meat (especially with pork) it will often cause the hot coals to flame up. Watch carefully and make sure to prevent the flames from burning the meat. Remove the skewer for a few seconds if the flames are large.


            </li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 2 equal parts and spread it on a clean, floured surface with a rolling pin. Using a glass or a round pastry mold, mold the dough to a diameter of 3 cm and then smooth and spread each part with a rolling pin. 
                Tip: Use a stick to push the coals around to put out the flame. Make sure the coals are evenly dispersed. The trick is to have all the glowing coals burning (not flaming) consistently. This method of slow-cooking the meat over an open fire not only makes the meat tender but it also will add tremendous flavor.


            </li>
